                    <p>In Australia, approximately one in ten infants require care in neonatal intensive care units (NICU) due to various underlying conditions. These high-risk infants face potential long-term health and developmental challenges, including issues related to preterm birth, respiratory difficulties, feeding problems, and other complex health issues. Despite improvements in medical care, these infants still face a high risk of health and developmental issues, with rates as high as 50% among survivors. Social disadvantage further exacerbates their challenges. To address this, the "Precision Newborn Health" program aims to provide personalized and coordinated healthcare for high-risk infants in NICU. The program will leverage technologies like Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, and Bioinformatics to predict illness severity and identify those who would benefit most from timely interventions. Treatment programs will be tailored to each child's individual needs, and the program will be developed in collaboration with consumers and end-users to ensure its relevance and feasibility.</p>
