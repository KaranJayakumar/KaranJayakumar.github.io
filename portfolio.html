                    <div class="project-desc">
                        <p>The project focuses on developing Deep Learning-based Artificial Intelligence (AI) tools to improve the precision of diagnosing stroke patients. Currently, neuroimaging techniques used to assess stroke have varying diagnostic accuracies. The goal is to utilize Computed Tomography (CT) scans and Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) scans as a gold standard to validate new models. The aim is to provide better accuracy in diagnosing stroke and ensure appropriate treatment to save brain tissue. This project is crucial considering the significant number of stroke cases worldwide and the associated mortality rate. By leveraging AI technology, the project aims to contribute to more effective stroke diagnosis and improve patient outcomes.</p>

                    <div class="project-desc">
                        <p>Very preterm birth is a leading cause of developmental delay, resulting in ongoing impairments in the majority of affected children. However, there is currently no universal surveillance system or adequate follow-up programs for these children and their families. The aim of this project is to reduce the burden of developmental impairment in children born very preterm. The project consists of four inter-related projects, which include identifying risk factors for developmental impairments, developing risk prediction models using machine learning, co-designing a targeted surveillance program based on a child's level and profile of risk, and evaluating the implementation of the surveillance program at state and national levels. The vision is to develop a family-friendly, pragmatic, and sustainable surveillance service that meets the needs of the child and their family and can be implemented nationwide.</p>

                    <h1>Precision Newborn Health: targeting high risk infants to improve lifelong health</h2>
                    <div class="project-desc">
                        <p>In Australia, approximately one in ten infants require care in neonatal intensive care units (NICU) due to various underlying conditions. These high-risk infants face potential long-term health and developmental challenges, including issues related to preterm birth, respiratory difficulties, feeding problems, and other complex health issues. Despite improvements in medical care, these infants still face a high risk of health and developmental issues, with rates as high as 50% among survivors. Social disadvantage further exacerbates their challenges. To address this, the "Precision Newborn Health" program aims to provide personalized and coordinated healthcare for high-risk infants in NICU. The program will leverage technologies like Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, and Bioinformatics to predict illness severity and identify those who would benefit most from timely interventions. Treatment programs will be tailored to each child's individual needs, and the program will be developed in collaboration with consumers and end-users to ensure its relevance and feasibility.</p>

                    <div class="project-desc">
                        <p>Parkinson’s disease (PD) is a progressive neuro-degenerative disorder increasingly prevalent over the age of 65. In Australia, about 80,000 Australians suffer from PD. Changes in voice are amongst the earliest symptoms of the disease, preceding the motor manifestations by up to 9 years. Computed tomography (CT) images can be used to detect vocal fold motion changes related to these changes in voice. The anatomical position of the vocal folds is affected by the patient position, motion, phonation and breathing during scanning. Currently, radiologists manually adjust the vocal fold plane to analyse vocal cord changes manually. The large amount of modern CT imaging data capturing vocal fold plane makes it laborious and time-consuming. Localizing the vocal fold plane is a complex task and no known research automates the vocal fold plane extraction. Previously, we also worked to track tumour using PET images.</p>

                    <div class="project-desc">
                        <p>Several neurological disorders affect the motor system in the brain. This results in deprivation of purposeful movement by the patient and affects the normal interaction with the environment. The specialized nerve cells in the lower and upper motor neurons of the brain control the skeletal muscles. Any neurological problem affecting the motor neurons will result in the manifestation of the problem in the hands and limbs. The symptoms may include tremors, rigidity, spasticity, weakness and inaccurate movement. One of the milestones of modern management of acute stroke is the administration of a thrombolytic (clot-busting medication) to unblock the artery. Continuous monitoring of patients is critical in the management of stroke patients. However, the current clinical observation paradigm is time consuming and subject to inter-observer bias. The project aims to develop wearable devices with Edge Computing and Artificial Intelligence (AI) models to understand and predict patient recovery.</p>
